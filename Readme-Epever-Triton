The Epever Triton solar chargers work with an RS485 interface that uses a special kernel module.
Download the source from the link below and compile it for your device. Works well with Raspberry Pi's.
Be aware that Pi Zeros and Pi 3/54 are different binaries and you need to recompile if you change hardware.
You may need to install gcc if you dont have a build environment. 
# apt install gcc

https://github.com/kasbert/epsolar-tracer/tree/master/xr_usb_serial_common-1a

As root, cd to the source folder you just downloaded
# make

Now install the kernel module.
# insmod ./xr_usb_serial_common.ko

If you have installed the xr_usb module correctly, when you plug in your Epever cable into your Pi you should see /dev/ttyXRUSB0 appear.

If it doesn't work, you may need to remove the competing CDC-ACM module. Check if cdc-acm is installed with 
# lsmod | grep cdc

if its there do
# rmmod cdc-acm

then ensure the cdc module is not reloaded next boot time

# echo blacklist cdc-acm > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cdc-acm.conf
# update-initramfs -u

Now try to install the xr module again and see if the correct /dev/ttyXRUSB0 interface appears
# insmod ./xr_usb_serial_common.ko

Tip: always run 'dmesg' and look at the last few lines after plugging/unplugging any USB interfaces, to see what the kernel thinks has changed.
