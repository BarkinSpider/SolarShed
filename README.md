# SolarShed
Realtime data monitoring and control of solar power equipment metrics

Most of the projects here are based around using a Raspberry Pi Zero or Pi 4 hardware.
Once Raspian light OS (no GUI) is installed, the monitoring suite of
Grafana, Prometheus and node_exporter are installed and configured.

Before continuing you need to have node_exporter showing all your system metrics in Grafana.
This is easy to achieve and very well documented as node_exporter is the #1 use of Grafana

Once working, its easy to add additional metrics and make your own dashboards.

Here is additonal information and guide to setting up node_exporter on any system.
